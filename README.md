# Erro

Forked from [snwfdhmp/errlog](https://github.com/snwfdhmp/errlog) because I needed more of an error library that is
developer friendly than a debugging tool.

## Introduction

Use Erro to improve error logging and **speed up  debugging while you create amazing code** :

- Highlight source code
- **Detect and point out** which func call is causing the fail
- Pretty stack trace
- **No-op mode** for production

### Example Output
